recompiler/snes_cycles.py -- Authoritative 65816 / SNES cycle cost model.

This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for cycle accounting, consumed by both
backends (Axis 2 of SNES_ACCURACY_BURNDOWN.md):

  * the v2 recompiler emitter (gen time): folds a block's instructions to a
    per-block integer constant of CPU cycles (near-free; stays fast);
  * the dev-only reference engine (interp816, when reconciled onto this
    branch): evaluates the same model at runtime.

To keep the C side (runtime / reference engine) from ever drifting from this
Python authority, run ``python recompiler/snes_cycles.py --emit-c
runner/src/snes/snes_cycles.h``: it bakes the per-opcode static contribution
tables (base, m-add, x-add, dp-add, page-cross, branch class, e-class) into a
generated header whose inline combiner mirrors ``instr_cpu_cycles`` below.
The arrays are the source of truth; the combination logic is small and is
asserted equivalent by tests/test_snes_cycles.py.

PROVENANCE (owner directive 2026-06-27: datasheet-checked, not invented)
================================================================================

Two layers, two grounded references, cross-checked:

  LAYER 1 - 65816 CPU (bus) cycles per instruction
    Source: undisbeliever, "65816 Reference: Opcodes"
            https://undisbeliever.net/snesdev/65816-opcodes.html
    Base cycle counts assume the minimum case: m=1 (8-bit A/mem), x=1 (8-bit
    index), Direct-Page register low byte D.l == 0, no index page-cross,
    conditional branch NOT taken, native mode (e=0) except where an e-modifier
    is noted. Documented conditional modifiers:
      +1 if m=0      16-bit accumulator/memory access (loads/stores/ALU/STZ/BIT)
      +2 if m=0      read-modify-write on memory (ASL/LSR/ROL/ROR/INC/DEC/TSB/TRB)
      +1 if x=0      16-bit index op (LDX/LDY/STX/STY/CPX/CPY, PHX/PHY/PLX/PLY)
      +1 if D.l != 0 any Direct-Page-based addressing mode (and PEI)
      +1 if x-cross  read op whose abs,X / abs,Y / (dp),Y effective addr crosses
                     a 256-byte page (NOT stores, NOT long,X)
      +1 if taken    conditional branch taken
      +1 more        taken branch that crosses a page, EMULATION mode only (e=1)
      +1 if e=0      RTI / BRK / COP in native mode

  LAYER 2 - SNES master-clock cost per memory access ("speed map")
    Source: undisbeliever 65816 page + fullsnes (problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm),
            cross-checked against snes.nesdev.org/wiki/Timing for the 12-cycle
            cell (the fullsnes auto-summary mis-stated $4000-$41FF as 8; the
            nesdev wiki and SFC dev wiki confirm 12 / "XSlow").
    Master clock = 21.47727 MHz. One access costs 6, 8, or 12 master clocks:
      6  (fast,  3.58 MHz): $00-$3F:$2000-$3FFF, $00-$3F:$4200-$5FFF,
                            and $80-$FF:$8000-$FFFF when FastROM (MEMSEL=1)
      8  (slow,  2.68 MHz): $00-$3F:$0000-$1FFF (WRAM mirror),
                            $00-$3F:$6000-$7FFF, $00-$3F:$8000-$FFFF (LoROM),
                            $40-$7D, $7E-$7F (WRAM),
                            and $80-$FF:$8000-$FFFF when slow (MEMSEL=0)
      12 (xslow):           $00-$3F:$4000-$41FF (manual joypad / internal I/O)
    The $80-$BF:$0000-$7FFF half mirrors $00-$3F:$0000-$7FFF (same speeds).
    Internal CPU cycles (no bus access) are 6 master clocks (fast).

================================================================================
SCOPE NOTE (honest layering, per the completeness directive)
================================================================================
Layer 1 (CPU cycles) and Layer 2 (region speed) are each EXACT and fully
grounded. The combiner ``instr_master_cycles`` that maps an instruction to
master clocks is a documented FIRST-CUT model: it charges the opcode+operand
fetch bytes at the code region's speed and the remaining cycles at the data
region's speed (internal-only cycles at fast/6). Bus-cycle-EXACT attribution
(modelling each individual access in the instruction's bus sequence, as bsnes
does) is the explicit Axis-2 refinement that the cyc_watch harness will
quantify against the bsnes ground-truth hook. The approximation is isolated to
the combiner; nothing here fabricates a "good enough" number silently.
