"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.emit_bank

Bank-level emit driver: walks every cfg entry in one bank and emits a
complete C source file containing every function as a separate
`void bank_BB_AAAA(CpuState *cpu)` definition.

Replaces v1's per-bank emit driver (the call-site of `emit_function`
inside `recomp.py`'s top-level `main()`).

Public API:
    emit_bank(rom, bank, entries, *, file_name=None,
              mode_overrides=None) -> str

`entries` is a list of `BankEntry` records describing each function to
emit. The caller (cfg loader, in Phase 6c) is responsible for parsing
the cfg and building this list.
