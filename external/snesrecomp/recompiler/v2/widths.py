"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.widths

The ONLY place width-dependent C-string literals live in the v2 codegen.

Background — DRY_REFACTOR.md (2026-04-30): four structurally-identical
width bugs shipped in eight days, each at a different `_emit_*` site
in `codegen.py`. The pattern of each fix was the same: take the
already-on-IR `op.width`, derive `0xFF`/`0xFFFF`, `0x80`/`0x8000`, etc.,
and either mask an operand or set N/Z. That per-emitter derivation is
what let the next sibling bug land — every new emitter had to remember
both the literal and the mask shape, and any one of them could forget.

Centralizing here means:
- A new emitter cannot forget to mask: it has no other way to spell it.
- A new bug shape can be fixed once, not at every site.
- The lint at `tools/lint_codegen_widths.py` mechanically rejects raw
  width literals appearing anywhere outside this module.

Functions return strings or lists of strings ready to be joined into
emitted C. They take only the IR's `width: int` (1 or 2) and raw
operand-name strings; no IR types, no decoder dependency.
