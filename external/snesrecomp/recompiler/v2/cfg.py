"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.cfg

Basic-block CFG keyed by (PC, M, X). Built on top of the v2 decoder
(decoder.py) — block identity is `DecodeKey(pc, m, x)`, the same key
the decoder uses. Same `pc` reached with different `(m, x)` produces
two distinct blocks, never silently merged.

Replaces the v1 `recompiler/cfg.py` whose blocks are keyed by `pc`
alone — that was structurally unable to represent mode-divergent
joins, which is exactly what the v2 redesign is fixing.

Public API:
    build_cfg(graph: FunctionDecodeGraph) -> V2CFG

V2CFG carries:
    blocks: Dict[DecodeKey, V2Block]
