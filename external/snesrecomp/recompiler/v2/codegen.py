"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.codegen

Emit C code from v2 IR. Generated functions take a single
`CpuState *cpu` parameter and mutate `cpu->A`, `cpu->X`, etc., directly
— no return values, no per-function locals masquerading as registers.

Replaces v1 EmitCtx C-expression-string-based codegen
(recomp.py:2829-6200) including the heuristic phi machinery
(_branch_states, _label_a/b/x/y, _emit_backedge_phi, _emit_branch,
_ensure_mutable_x). v2 codegen has no per-function abstract register
state at emit time — register reads/writes are explicit memory loads
and stores against the CpuState struct.

Every IR Value produced by an IR op becomes a fresh C local. A
`Value(vid=N)` lowers to `_v<N>`. Width is inferred per op (the IR
op type carries the width).

Public API:
    emit_block(block: IRBlock, *, indent: str = "  ") -> List[str]

Phase 5 of plan parsed-skipping-rainbow.md. Phase 6 will wire this
into a per-function emit driver (replacing the v1 emit_function) and
run the full SMW regen against it.

    """RTS / RTL / RTI emit. Reads + clears the function-LOCAL
    `_pending_skip` (set by an upstream NLR-pattern block on the same
    path) and returns its value. NORMAL paths get _pending_skip == 0
    == RECOMP_RETURN_NORMAL.

    `_pending_skip` is declared at the top of every emitted function
    by emit_function.py — see the prologue there for design rationale.
    NOT cpu->pending_skip: NLR signaling is C control-flow state, not
    65816 hardware state, and storing it on CpuState invited
    optimizer/aliasing weirdness around the cpu pointer.

    cpu_trace_pending_skip_consume is a non-rotating counter (separate
    from the cpu_trace ring, which rotates) so probes can answer "did
    any Return on this run read non-zero _pending_skip ever" — even
    after the ring has rotated past boot.

    The `return ...;` line stays at the start of its line so the
    per-line scanner in emit_function.py auto-injects RecompStackPop()
    before it.

    PEI-trampoline dispatch (2026-05-24, narrow variant). The post-
    lowering stack-delta analyser flags Return sites that are
    reachable with non-zero cpu->S delta from function entry (e.g.,
    the bank_04_9A02 PEI-trampoline in MMX). For those sites, codegen
    emits an extra branch: when `_pending_skip == NORMAL` AND the
    delta is non-zero at runtime, pop `frame_size` bytes from cpu->S,
    construct (PB:PC+1), tail-call cpu_dispatch_pc. The runtime check
    against `_entry_s` keeps the standard `return _ps;` path on the
    balanced subset of the function's paths (a single Return op may
    be reachable from both balanced and trampoline paths through the
    same join block — the static flag fires on either, but the
    runtime branch picks the right behaviour per execution).
