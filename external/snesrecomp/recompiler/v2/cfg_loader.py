"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.cfg_loader

Parse a v1-format bank cfg file into a v2 `BankCfg` dataclass that
`emit_bank` can consume.

v2 IGNORES the v1 ABI-fiction directives:
- `sig:` — every v2 function is `void f(CpuState *cpu)`.
- `ret_y` / `carry_ret` — return value is never materialised; flags
  and registers live in the CpuState struct.
- `y_after:` / `x_after:` — call-site index increments are dead with
  the new ABI (caller and callee both see cpu->X / cpu->Y).
- `restores_x:` / DP-aliased struct params (e.g. `CollInfo_*ci`) —
  same, dead.

v2 KEEPS:
- `bank = NN`
- `includes = ...` (used to extend the default emit_bank header).
- `func <name> <hex_pc> [end:<hex_end>] [entry_mx:M,X]` — the entry
  list. `entry_mx` overrides the default reset-state M/X width for
  hand-written entries whose ABI is only valid after caller-side setup.
- `entry_mx_at <hex_pc> <M> <X>` — the same entry-width override, kept
  outside auto-ingested func blocks so those blocks stay regeneratable.
- `continuation_entry <name> <hex_pc> [end:<hex_end>] [entry_mx:M,X]`
  — an explicit dispatchable entry inside an existing routine. It emits a
  fresh C activation from that PC while preserving the guest CPU/stack as-is;
  intended for scheduler resume and return continuations, not a duplicated
  hand-written implementation.
- `aot_boundary:yield|terminate` — typed explicit-AOT exit at a real `func`
  entry. Outside an explicit AOT activation the decoded guest body executes
  normally; inside one, control returns to the interpreter at that same PC.
- `aot_boundary_pc:<hex_pc24>` — optional guest/logical PC returned by that
  boundary when it differs from the physical bank/CFG location.
- `end_at <hex_pc> <hex_end>` — override a generated function's
  exclusive end boundary outside auto-ingested func blocks.
- `name <hex_addr> <name>` — friendly-naming for cross-bank labels.
  v2 emits these as `void NAME(CpuState *cpu);` forward declarations
  in funcs.h (Phase 6e/f). For now we just retain them.
- `exclude_range <start> <end>` — data region carved out of decode.
- `data_region <bank> <start> <end>` — same idea, cross-bank.
