"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.exit_mx_autoroute

Per-variant function exit-(M, X) inference for EVERY cfg `func` entry,
including non-leaf functions that call other cfg-declared subroutines.

The cfg `exit_mx_at <addr> <m> <x>` directive declares that the callee
at `<addr>` exits with (M, X) = (m, x). The v2 decoder consults this
when emitting JSR/JSL fall-through edges so the caller resumes decoding
with the right operand widths after the call. Without an entry, the
decoder assumes (M, X) are preserved — wrong whenever the callee runs
an internal SEP/REP that never restores before RTS/RTL. SMW's
`$00:F465` is the canonical case (`SEP #$20` first, no restore; root
cause of "Mario dies on slope" 2026-05-03).

History:

  - 2026-05-03 (reverted): unconstrained iterative fixpoint over every
    (addr, m, x) tuple. Regressed `GraphicsDecompress` into an infinite
    loop — intermediate exit-(M, X) values polluted the analyzer
    along unreachable paths.

  - 2026-05-13 → 2026-05-15: pivoted to leaf-only auto-detection.
    Functions with any internal JSR/JSL were skipped; their exit
    state required hand-written cfg directives. This covered ~31
    SMW sites cleanly but left non-leaf SEP/RTS dispatchers
    (`PlayerState00_00F9C9`, `BufferScrollingTiles_Layer1_Init`,
    etc.) needing manual hints. Three hints accreted across three
    sessions — same shape every time — exposing this as an unfinished
    class.

  - 2026-05-16 (this): drop the leaf-only restriction. The decoder's
    PHP/PLP-bracketed M/X tracking (snesrecomp 73e3d26) closed the
    soundness gap that broke the 2026-05-03 fixpoint. With that gap
    closed, single-direction iterative inference is sound:

      * Information flow is monotonic — every committed
        (target_pc24, em, ex) → (exit_m, exit_x) is never revised.
      * Each pass walks every cfg func and tries the variants not
        yet recorded. Decode uses the current `callee_exit_mx`.
      * Ambiguous exits (`analyze_function_exit_mx` returns None)
        are skipped, never papered over.
      * Bounded at 8 iterations defensively; SMW typical converges
        in 2-3.

Per-variant recording: each `(target_pc24, em, ex) → (exit_m, exit_x)`
is recorded individually in `cfg.exit_mx_at_per_variant`. The legacy
`cfg.exit_mx_at` 4-tuple broadcast is now reserved for hand-written
cfg directives (which are treated as authoritative — seeded first into
`callee_exit_mx` so they win over auto-detection).

Why per-variant is mandatory: many functions have variant-dependent
exits. A leaf with `REP #$20 ; RTS` always exits m=0 but preserves
entry X, so per-(entry_x) recording is the only correct model.
Broadcasting the cfg-default's exit to all four variants poisons
non-default callers — the original Bug C visual cascade was caused
by exactly this misanalysis.

Mutates each `BankCfg.exit_mx_at_per_variant` list in place. The
v2_regen.py `callee_exit_mx` builder consumes per-variant entries
directly, no broadcasting.

    exit_x) if the body decoded cleanly with an unambiguous exit
    state, else None.

    Unlike the old `_decode_leaf_exit`, this does NOT skip functions
    that contain JSR/JSL. Soundness comes from:

      - PHP/PLP-bracketed M/X tracking in the decoder (snesrecomp
        73e3d26) — `PLP` correctly restores M/X to whatever PHP saved,
        so functions with internal SEP/REP wrapped in PHP/PLP get the
        right post-RTS state.
      - `callee_exit_mx` passed in: prior auto-router iterations have
        already determined exits for shorter-call-chain callees;
        this function inherits their state at JSR/JSL fall-through.
      - `analyze_function_exit_mx` returns None for ambiguous exits
        (multiple RTS paths disagree); we skip those.
      - `dispatch_helpers` passed in: lets the decoder recognise SMW's
        `JSL <helper>; <data table>` pattern as a dispatch terminator
        instead of misdecoding the table bytes as garbage code. With
        the helper map, dispatch JSLs land in the decode graph with
        `dispatch_entries` set and no fall-through successors, and
        `analyze_function_exit_mx` propagates exits through them.

    The 2026-05-03 iterative-fixpoint attempt regressed
    `GraphicsDecompress` because intermediate (m, x) values polluted
    the analyzer's downstream decisions. The mitigation here:

      - Single-direction information flow: callee_exit_mx only ever
        grows; we never revise a previously-committed exit.
      - Iteration bound: max 5 passes (typical SMW is 2-3).
      - Ambiguity gate: only commit when both m and x are determinate.

    """Auto-detect per-variant function exit-(M, X) state.

    Algorithm:

    1. Seed `callee_exit_mx` from hand-written cfg `exit_mx_at`
       directives (broadcast 4-tuple → all 4 entry variants). These
       seeds are IMMUTABLE for the duration of the analysis — the
       autoroute never overrides a hand-written hint.

    2. Iterate up to `_MAX_ITERS` passes. Each pass RE-DERIVES every
       cfg `func` entry's exit at every entry variant (skipping
       seeded keys) using the current `callee_exit_mx`. If the
       derived exit differs from the previously stored one, update
       `callee_exit_mx` and mark the pass dirty.

    3. Stop when a pass changes nothing (fixpoint), or after
       `_MAX_ITERS` passes (defensive bound).

    4. After fixpoint, emit `cfg.exit_mx_at_per_variant` entries for
       every (target, em, ex) whose final exit differs from entry
       (the "mutating" set).

    Per-variant emission: each `(target, entry_m, entry_x) → (exit_m,
    exit_x)` is recorded individually. The legacy `cfg.exit_mx_at`
    4-tuple broadcast is reserved for hand-written cfg directives;
    auto-detected exits go to `cfg.exit_mx_at_per_variant`.

    Soundness — why re-derivation is now correct:

      - PHP/PLP bracketing is modeled by the decoder (snesrecomp
        73e3d26); the previous PHP/PLP gap that biased the
        2026-05-03 fixpoint is closed.
      - Ambiguous exits (analyze_function_exit_mx returns None) are
        skipped, not papered over with a guess.
      - Each pass's analysis is a function of the current
        callee_exit_mx (no other mutable state), so any oscillation
        would have to come from a non-monotone update rule — which
        we don't have.

    Why the previous "commit-once, never revise" rule was buggy:

      Consider `WallRun` (`INX INX REP #$20 ; ... JSR $F465 ; RTS`)
      and `F465` (`SEP #$20 ; ... RTS`). WallRun at M1X1 entry hits
      the REP, then JSRs $F465 at em=0, ex=1. The correct chain:
      F465's exit at (0, 1) is (1, 1) (SEP #$20 forces m=1), so
      WallRun's post-JSR state is (1, 1) and its RTS exit is (1, 1).
      But if pass 1 analyses WallRun BEFORE F465 is recorded, the
      decoder default-preserves the JSR fall-through state and
      computes WallRun's exit as (0, 1). The old "commit-once" rule
      then locked that wrong (0, 1) record in even after F465
      committed (1, 1) in pass 2. Downstream callers of WallRun_M1X1
      cascade through the wrong post-call state into phantom
      M0X1-tracked code regions that runtime never reaches at m=0
      (the 2026-05-16 `RunPlayerBlockCode_00F28C_M0X1` verifier trip
      was this cascade). Re-deriving per pass fixes the order-
      dependence.

    Hand-written cfg `exit_mx_at` directives win at the same
    (target_pc24, em, ex) key — `seeded_keys` are skipped in every
    re-derivation pass and the per-variant emit step.
