"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.emitter_helpers

Cross-cutting emitter patterns that aren't width-bound.

Distinct from `widths.py` — this module collects code-shape helpers
that don't take an `op.width` parameter. The first inhabitant is
the JSL/JSR bank save+restore envelope.

Background — DRY_REFACTOR.md follow-up B (2026-04-30): the JSL
emitter and the dispatch-table emitter both inline the same 6-line
"save PB; trace; set PB to target bank; CALL; trace; restore PB"
sequence. The duplication has the same risk shape as the width-mask
class — a future emitter forgets one of the trace calls or the
restore, and PB drifts. Centralizing here keeps the call-site
shape in one place.

# ── Stack push/pop micro-pattern helpers (DRY_REFACTOR follow-up C) ────
#
# The 65816 stack has post-decrement-push, pre-increment-pop semantics.
# A byte push decrements S after the write; a word push decrements S
# both before and after, so the word ends up at S+1 (low) and S+2 (high).
# Pop is the inverse.
#
# Without these helpers, every stack-touching emitter reimplements the
# decrement/increment dance. Risk class: get the order wrong (decrement
# before write in a byte push, or skip the second decrement on a word
# push) and the stack frame ends up shifted by one byte. Symptom would
# be an apparent off-by-one in subsequent PLA/PLB pulls.
