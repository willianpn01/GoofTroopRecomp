## LakeSnes — 65816 CPU core

`runner/src/snes/interp816.{c,h}`, the 65816 interpreter backing the
interpreter-fallback tier (see `docs/MULTI_TIER.md`), is derived from the CPU
core of **LakeSnes** by angelo_wf.

### Derivation / modifications

Recovered from `runner/src/snes/cpu.c` as it existed at commit `9de9855^` —
the snesrecomp tree's original LakeSnes adaptation, before the unused
interpreter was ripped on 2026-04-20 — then re-vendored for the
interpreter-fallback tier with:

- symbols namespaced `cpu_*` / `Cpu` → `interp816_*` / `Interp816` so the core
  coexists with the legacy `Cpu` debug shadow (`runner/src/snes/cpu.{c,h}`);
- the hardwired `snes_cpuRead` / `snes_cpuWrite` bus replaced with a
  caller-supplied callback bus (so the production adapter can route memory
  through the AOT `cpu_read8` / `cpu_write8` HLE bus);
- snesrecomp debug instrumentation removed (`pc_hist` / `DumpCpuHistory` and
  the top-of-`doOpcode` assert tripwire);
- `WAI` restored to stock behavior (`waiting = true`, was an assert);
- `BRK` routed to the `interp816_opcode_hook` bridge seam.

The exact transform is reproducible: `git show 9de9855^:runner/src/snes/cpu.c`,
then the renames + seam edits described above. The vendored core is validated
by `tests/interp816/` (directed opcode harness).
