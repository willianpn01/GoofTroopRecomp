/*
 * snesrecomp v2 runtime CpuState.
 *
 * The single mutable container for 65816 register + flag state at
 * runtime. Every v2-recompiled function takes `CpuState *cpu` as its
 * sole parameter and mutates `cpu->A`, `cpu->X`, etc., directly. No
 * return values, no per-function locals masquerading as registers.
 *
 * REPLACES v1's per-function locals + decode-time M/X metadata fiction
 * + struct-packed return types (RetAY, RetY, PairU16, HdmaPtrs, etc.).
 *
 * v2 hand-written runtime bodies (NMI/IRQ entry, PPU/DMA orchestration,
 * etc.) keep working because `cpu->ram` aliases `g_ram` and existing
 * `g_ram[addr]` reads/writes from those bodies see the same bytes the
 * recompiled code sees.
 *
 * `m_flag` / `x_flag` / `emulation` are mirrors of P bits 5, 4, and the
 * E flag respectively. They're carried as their own slots so codegen
 * doesn't have to re-decode P every memory access; `RepFlags` /
 * `SepFlags` keep them in sync with `P` on every update.

 *     PLA          ; pop own JSR return PC high
 *     ...          ; (or 3 PLAs for JSL/RTL)
 *     RTS          ; now pops grandparent's return PC
 *
 * In v2 codegen, JSR/JSL/RTS/RTL don't push or pop return-PC bytes on
 * the simulated SNES stack — those are tracked purely via C call
 * frames. So translating PLA literally as `cpu->S += 1; A = ram[S]`
 * would consume bytes that belong to AN ANCESTOR'S stack frame and
 * leave the SNES S register drifted (root cause of "DB=$C0 at
 * ProcessGameMode entry" 2026-05-02).
 *
 * Instead, the v2 ABI returns a small enum: NORMAL means "RTS to
 * immediate caller"; SKIP_N means "skip N additional levels of C
 * return" (i.e., the asm RTS would have unwound past N JSR frames).
 *
 * Callsite contract (emitted by codegen):
 *     RecompReturn _r = Callee(cpu);
 *     if (_r != RECOMP_RETURN_NORMAL) {
 *         return (RecompReturn)((int)_r - 1);

/* ── Typed register access ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 65816 accumulator/index registers carry semantic width via M/X
 * flags. The hardware contracts:
 *   - A (m=1):  ops touch only A.low; A.high (= B) is preserved.
 *   - A (m=0):  ops touch full 16 bits.
 *   - X/Y (x=1): ops touch only the low byte; the high byte is FORCED
 *                to 0 on write (hw contract — distinct from A).
 *   - X/Y (x=0): full 16-bit.
 *
 * Use the typed helpers below at every codegen site that reads or
 * writes A/X/Y. The function name encodes the width explicitly:
 *
 *   cpu_read_a8 / a16 / x8 / x16 / y8 / y16     (bare-width readers)
 *   cpu_write_a8 / a16 / x8 / x16 / y8 / y16    (bare-width writers)
 *   cpu_read_a_m  / x_x  / y_x                   (M/X-flag dispatching reads)
 *   cpu_write_a_m / x_x  / y_x                   (M/X-flag dispatching writes)
 *
 * Why typed helpers instead of raw `cpu->A`:
 *   1. The READ TYPE forces the caller to think about width. A bare
 *      `cpu->A` returns 16 bits even in M=1 contexts; the caller can
 *      forget to mask, and the bug only surfaces when the high byte
 *      happens to be non-zero (the SMW XBA stale-shadow class).
 *   2. The WRITE semantics differ between A (preserve high) and X/Y
 *      (zero high). Encoding it in the helper name removes the foot-gun
 *      of a contributor copy-pasting the wrong shape.
 *   3. M/X-flag dispatch lives in ONE place (the helper) rather than
 *      inline at every emit site. If a future hardware nuance is
 *      discovered, it lands in the helper and every site picks it up.

 *
 * Codegen emits a trampoline-aware RTS/RTL ONLY for functions flagged
 * by the PEI/PEA/PER detector in emit_function.py. On those functions,
 * when cpu->S != _entry_s at the Return site, _emit_return pops the
 * topmost frame (2 bytes for RTS, 3 for RTL), computes (PB:PC+1), and
 * tail-calls cpu_dispatch_pc(cpu, pc24). The helper binary-searches
 * g_dispatch_table for an entry matching `pc24` and invokes the variant
 * fnptr for the runtime (m,x) flags. If pc24 isn't a known function
 * entry (typically a mid-function PC reached at the bottom of a
 * trampoline chain), the helper returns RECOMP_RETURN_NORMAL and the
 * host C call stack unwinds.
 *
 * The dispatch table is emitted by v2_regen.py at the end of each
 * regen run into `<prefix>_dispatch_v2.c`. Entries are sorted by
 * pc24 for binary search. Each row holds up to 4 fnptrs (one per
 * (m,x) variant). */

 * reaching one cannot host-return normally. The game's yield hle_func stubs

 * request and CONTINUES INTERPRETING at resume_pc24 — the primitive's REAL

 * already pushed for JSR-reached primitives). The interpreter then performs
 * the actual coroutine switch (state/countdown -> $30/$31,X, TSC -> saved-S
 * slot, re-enter the slot walk) byte-exact by construction — no hand-written
 * effect duplication, no fibers.
