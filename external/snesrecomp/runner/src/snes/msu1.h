/* MSU-1 — SNES streaming-audio + data coprocessor (near's spec).
 *
 * Two channels:
 *   - Data:  a byte-addressable file (<base>.msu) read through a seek
 *            pointer ($2000-$2003 write) + auto-incrementing read port
 *            ($2001 read).
 *   - Audio: 44.1 kHz signed-16 stereo PCM tracks (<base>-<N>.pcm),
 *            selected via $2004-$2005, played/looped via $2007, mixed on
 *            top of the S-DSP output at the host rate.
 *
 * The register window ($2000-$2007) already routes through the
 * framework's ReadReg/WriteReg dispatch (is_hw_reg covers $2000-$5FFF),
 * so wiring is just a branch there plus the audio mix in RtlRenderAudio.
 *
 * Default-OFF: with no pack present (env SNESRECOMP_MSU1 unset) every
 * entry point is inert and the registers read back as open bus (0),
 * exactly as before — output stays byte-identical.
