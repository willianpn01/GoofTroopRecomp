/* Always-on audio observability rings.
 *
 * Captures, continuously from process start (Release/Production too, per
 * the ring-buffer observability discipline):
 *
 *   1. PCM ring   — every native DSP output sample dsp_cycle produces,
 *                   recorded BEFORE the output-ring overflow check, so
 *                   samples dropped at the dsp->sampleBuffer cap are
 *                   still visible here.
 *   2. Event ring — every DSP register write (KON/KOF/pitch/volume/...),
 *                   overflow-drop runs, and consume (dsp_getSamples)
 *                   events, all timestamped in native-sample time.
 *   3. Counters   — produced/dropped/consumed totals, producer
 *                   attribution (CPU-thread catch-up vs audio-thread
 *                   top-up), output-ring occupancy high-water, and a
 *                   once-per-second snapshot ring for rate analysis.
 *
 * All record hooks run under RtlApuLock (dsp_cycle / dsp_write /
 * dsp_getSamples are only reached with the APU lock held), so plain
 * fields suffice. Dump/query entry points take RtlApuLock themselves.
