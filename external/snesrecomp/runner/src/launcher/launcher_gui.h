// launcher_gui.h — shared RmlUi pre-boot launcher for snesrecomp games.
//
// Shown inside the runner's SDL/OpenGL window before the emulator boots, modeled
// on psxrecomp/runtime/launcher. The user picks/verifies a ROM, tunes settings
// (Display / Audio / Widescreen / Controllers / MSU-1), then presses PLAY. The
// chosen values are written back into the caller-owned SnesLauncherSettings (and
// the resolved ROM path), which the game's main.c maps onto its own Config and
// persists to config.ini / keybinds.ini.
//
// Design note (same as the PSX launcher): this module does NOT own the window or
// GL context — the caller passes an already-current GL 3.3 core context. That
// keeps it a pure overlay so a future "reopen settings while running" path can
// reuse it without owning the window lifecycle.
//
// The launcher is game-AGNOSTIC: it edits the shared subset below, never a
// game's private Config struct. Each game's main.c does the (tiny) mapping.
