/* cpu_trace.h — Backwards watcher for v2 SMW boot debugging.
 *
 * Two ring buffers + per-event hooks, all gated on SNESRECOMP_TRACE.
 * Compile-out cleanly when the macro is unset (every helper is a no-op
 * inline so Release|x64 ships the same as before).
 *
 * Goal: when cpu->DB or cpu->PB get poisoned, a `dump recent` from the
 * crash handler (or via debug-server cmd) tells us the EXACT prior
 * instructions and the FIRST mutation that produced the bad state.
 * Stack-deep crash output ("we died in foo") is necessary but not
 * sufficient — we need backwards visibility.
 *
 * Two rings:
 *   1. CpuTraceEvent[CPU_TRACE_RING_LEN]: every basic-block entry +
 *      every targeted state-mutation event. PCs + register snapshot.
 *   2. CpuDbpbEvent[CPU_DBPB_RING_LEN]: smaller ring of ONLY DB/PB
 *      mutations (PHK, PLB, PHB, PHK, PLP, MVN/MVP, RTL/JSL bank
 *      transitions). Survives churn in the main ring; lets us answer
 *      "show me the last 16 bank changes."
 *
 * Tripwires:
 *   cpu_trace_set_db_watch(byte): if cpu->DB gets set to that value,
 *      dump the rings to stderr immediately (caller-driven; we don't
 *      poll inside hot paths).

 * etc.) emits wrong code at the mismatch site.
 *
 * Accumulating table — NOT a one-shot tripwire. Every mismatch is
 * looked up by (func_name, runtime_m, runtime_x); a record's
 * hit_count is incremented and total_hits goes up. The first hit per
