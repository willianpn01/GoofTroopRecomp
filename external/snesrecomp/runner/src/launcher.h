/*
 * snesrecomp_launcher_resolve_rom
 *
 * Interactively resolve the path to a SNES ROM the recompiled game can use.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. argv[1] if present and not a flag (starts with '-').
 *   2. Cached path in <exe_dir>/rom.cfg.
 *   3. Win32 Open File dialog (".sfc / .smc"). Other platforms: error.
 *
 * If expected_crc != 0, the resolved file is CRC32-verified. On mismatch,
 * the user is prompted again (file picker re-opens). When using argv[1],
 * a CRC mismatch warns but does not re-prompt — backwards-compatible
 * with command-line invocation.
 *
 * The 512-byte SMC copier header (older copy-tool format) is auto-detected
 * by file size and stripped before CRC verification, so headered and
 * unheadered copies of the same ROM yield the same CRC.
 *
 * On success: writes the resolved absolute path into out_path and persists
 * it to rom.cfg next to the exe. Returns 1.
 *
 * On user cancel (no ROM selected) or repeated CRC failure with cancel:
 * out_path[0] = '\0' and returns 0.
 *
 * Caller is expected to call this from main() before any ROM byte is
 * touched. Game-specific runners should pass their known good CRC32, or
 * 0 to skip verification.

 * comes from a project that publishes SHA-256 (e.g. snesrev/zelda3).

 * silently; ANY other readable ROM also loads, but emits a warning (so
 * romhacks / other regions still run, just flagged). Only a missing/
 * unreadable file or a cancelled picker re-prompts.
 *
 * `hashes` is an array of `n_hashes` 32-byte digests (e.g. a vanilla hash
 * plus a known patched hash). Pass n_hashes==0 to accept anything silently.
 * Same SMC-copier-header handling as the other variants.

 * saves/ directory) resolves next to the exe — regardless of which cwd
 * the process was launched from. This is the whole config-discovery
 * policy: the config is the ini next to the exe, nothing else.
 *
 * Call it first thing in main(), before any file is opened. If any
 * command-line argument carries a relative path, absolutize it with
 * snesrecomp_abspath() BEFORE calling this, since the anchor changes
 * what relative paths mean.
 *
 * If the exe directory is not writable (AppImage squashfs mount, locked
 * system install) or can't be determined (no OS query mechanism), the
 * cwd is left untouched so saves and config land somewhere writable.
 * Returns 1 if cwd is now the exe directory, 0 if it was left alone.

 * even if something changes the CWD. Returns 1 and fills `out` on success;
