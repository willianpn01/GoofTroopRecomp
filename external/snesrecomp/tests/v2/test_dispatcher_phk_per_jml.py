"""Yoshi-block freeze ROOT 2026-05-02: PHK+PER+JML inline-dispatch
trampoline.

The asm idiom at $00:BFBC (GenerateTile_Dispatch):
    SEP #$30
    LDA $9C        ; Map16TileGenerate
    DEC A
    PHK
    PER $0003
    JML ExecutePtr ; runtime dispatcher at $00:86DF
    .dw target0, target1, ...   ; 16-bit handler table

ExecutePtr consumes the PHK+PER bytes, indexes the table, and JML.W
[$00] tail-calls the handler. End-to-end the asm is balanced.

v2 bug (pre-fix): codegen emits PHK + PER as raw stack writes, then
returns NORMAL on the JML (because Goto-with-no-successor). The 3
trampoline bytes leak onto the simulated stack; later PLX/PLP/RTL
in the caller (GenerateTile) reads garbage and X cascades into
camera + sprite state — visible as Mario freezing on the Yoshi
block.

Fix: when a JML targets a registered dispatch helper (which the
classifier already detects), the codegen now:
  - skips emit for the immediately-preceding PHK/PEA/PER (trampoline
    setup that the runtime dispatcher would have consumed);
  - synthesizes a switch over `cpu->A & 0xFF` calling each handler
    by name — a tail-call dispatch, terminator returning NORMAL.
