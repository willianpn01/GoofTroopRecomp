"""Lint pass over v2 codegen output.

Catches the next foot-gun in the cpu->B class:

  - "shadow" CPU fields that aren't part of the documented canonical
    state and don't have a sync mechanism (e.g., a contributor adds
    `cpu->Z` as a temporary cache and forgets every primary-Z writer
    has to update it).

  - Stale historical references to deleted shadow fields like cpu->B.

  - Unsynced shadow fields (declared in CpuState but not referenced
    from cpu_p_to_mirrors / cpu_mirrors_to_p, so REP/SEP/PLP wouldn't
    keep them coherent).

The lint scans the actual emitted gen/*.c sources rather than the
codegen.py emitter functions directly. That's the load-bearing surface
— if codegen.py emits an unexpected field through any conditional code
path, the gen output will reveal it. The lint runs as part of the
standard v2 test suite.

If a new field is genuinely needed:
  - canonical primary state goes in CANONICAL,
  - synced-from-P shadow goes in SHADOWS_FROM_P + cpu_p_to_mirrors,
  - any other shadow needs its own sync mechanism documented and added
    to ALLOWED with a comment explaining why it's safe.

This lint is the "before-the-third-repeat" project rule made
mechanical: it doesn't catch a stale-read bug at the use site (the
fuzz does that), but it catches the architectural shape that makes
stale-read bugs possible.
